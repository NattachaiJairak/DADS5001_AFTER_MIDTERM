# Advertising Campaign CTR Analysis

## Scenario:
I work for a marketing company, and my team has developed a new advertising campaign aimed at increasing the click-through rate (CTR) for a client's website. The current industry average CTR is known to be 17.43%.

My client is interested in knowing whether the new campaign has been effective in increasing the CTR for their website. To evaluate this, I collect data on the number of clicks generated by the new campaign out of the total number of impressions it received over a certain period.

## Dataset:
I collect data for a sample of 16,468,027 impressions generated by the new campaign, and I find that 5,947,563 of them resulted in clicks.

## Hypothesis:
My null hypothesis \( H_0 \) is that the proportion of clicks generated by the new campaign is equal to the industry average CTR of 17.43%.

The alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \) is that the proportion of clicks generated by the new campaign is greater than 17.43%.
