## Explanation of Code and Data Source

1. **Importing pandas**: The code starts by importing the pandas library, which is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    ```

2. **Defining the URL of the CSV file**: The variable `url` contains the URL of the CSV file that we want to read into a pandas DataFrame. This CSV file is hosted on GitHub.

    ```python
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NattachaiJairak/DADS5001_AFTER_MIDTERM/main/DADS5001_2024-03-23/Data_Homework.csv"
    ```

3. **Reading the CSV file into a DataFrame**: The `pd.read_csv()` function is used to read the CSV file from the specified URL into a pandas DataFrame named `df`.

    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv(url)
    ```

4. **Displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame**: The DataFrame `df` is displayed, showing the first few rows of the dataset. When a DataFrame is printed without using the `print()` function, Jupyter notebooks and interactive Python environments will display a formatted representation of the DataFrame.

    ```python
    df
    ```
