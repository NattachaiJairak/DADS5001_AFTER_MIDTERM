Certainly! Here's how you can present the explanation of the code in a `README.md` file:

## Explanation of Code and Data Source

1. **Importing pandas**: The code starts by importing the pandas library, which is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    ```

2. **Defining the URL of the CSV file**: The variable `url` contains the URL of the CSV file that we want to read into a pandas DataFrame. This CSV file is hosted on GitHub.

    ```python
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NattachaiJairak/DADS5001_AFTER_MIDTERM/main/DADS5001_2024-03-23/Data_Homework.csv"
    ```

3. **Reading the CSV file into a DataFrame**: The `pd.read_csv()` function is used to read the CSV file from the specified URL into a pandas DataFrame named `df`.

    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv(url)
    ```

4. **Displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame**: The DataFrame `df` is displayed, showing the first few rows of the dataset. When a DataFrame is printed without using the `print()` function, Jupyter notebooks and interactive Python environments will display a formatted representation of the DataFrame.

    ```python
    df
    ```

The data source mentioned in the code (`Data_Homework.csv`) appears to be related to a project named "CPEX" based on the file name. However, without additional context or information, it's challenging to provide specific details about the data source. 

If you could provide more information about the project "CPEX" and the nature of the data in `Data_Homework.csv`, I'd be happy to help further explain how the code interacts with the data and any analysis or processing that could be performed on it.

In the `Explanation of Code and Data Source` section, the code is explained step by step, highlighting its functionality and purpose. The section provides clarity on how the code interacts with the data source and the overall context of the code execution.
