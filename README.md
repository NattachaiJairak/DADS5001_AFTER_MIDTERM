Explanation of Code and Data Source
Importing pandas: The code starts by importing the pandas library, which is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
Defining the URL of the CSV file: The variable url contains the URL of the CSV file that we want to read into a pandas DataFrame. This CSV file is hosted on GitHub.

python
Copy code
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NattachaiJairak/DADS5001_AFTER_MIDTERM/main/DADS5001_2024-03-23/Data_Homework.csv"
Reading the CSV file into a DataFrame: The pd.read_csv() function is used to read the CSV file from the specified URL into a pandas DataFrame named df.

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv(url)
Displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame: The DataFrame df is displayed, showing the first few rows of the dataset. When a DataFrame is printed without using the print() function, Jupyter notebooks and interactive Python environments will display a formatted representation of the DataFrame.

python
Copy code
df
